### What is cLinux about
cLinux is a Work-in-progress Operating System for ComputerCraft made by Piorjade.

#### The idea:
    - Recreate the look of the Linux system
    - Secured and improved user and permission system, with changes on crucial functions
    - Executables are saved on /usr/bin
    - Use 'packman' as the package manager, as if it was 'apt'!
    - Give the user(s) the ability to add their own Desktop-Enviroment just as a plugin
    
#### Current functions:
    - Shortens the home directory to ~
    - Multi-user (WIP) organization and space
    - Basic commands added
    - 'packman' is added and working
    NOTE: You currently have no way to run the programs (or you install a runable app in /usr/bin, which wont be possible soon as normal user) --> this is my next goal <---- You now should not be able to use packman as normal user, because of the edited FS API
    basic functions are added in _G
    - Log-In as root (password: toor)
    - FS API modified for secured and (WIP) flawless security
    NOTE: More info on [the topic](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/27573-clinux-a-safe-linux-like-os-wip/)
        
#### Planned functions:
    - Log in as root
    - File editor
    - Run programs (evidently, with the Top Level Corroutine Override)
